# Stranger Things Quote Picker Application

My name is Ederes Gure, and the following is my explaination of my solution to the Software Developer Assessment.

I have used Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB Atlas alongside Axios and Dotenv in the project.

### Installation

Clone the fork from Github

cd into csf-intern-assessment and install the dependencies.

create an '.env' file and add the following MongoDB credentials:
DB_USER=admin
DB_PWD=OrjRfkYQc12ep32a

run the backend using npm run dev

navigate to http://localhost:7894 to access the application.

### Usage

On the home page, a form is shown where you can enter your name, age and select your favorite quote from the dropdown menu.

Pressing submit will send your data to the database. Be sure to refresh the page to see your response afterwards (As the data below is pulled directly from the database).

Each time you visit / refresh the page 10 new Stranger Things quotes are given.
