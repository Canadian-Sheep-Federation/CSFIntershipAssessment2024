# Enhancing the Frontend

I would start of by adding some CSS styling to improve the visuals of the HTML file. As it currently stands, it is nothing but a simple HTML page with no colours or changes with makes it bland and not very visually appealing. To improve I could use React alongside CSS for the future.

# Error Handling and Validation 

Currently the Backend side of this project does well to handle errors. However I feel that it can be greatly improved using the `Joi` library which would ensure that a descriptive message be included alongside the error

# Database Maintenance

I would use MongoDB for the future to create a database which can hold information rather than to discard it. Currently the in-memory database I've used with sqlite3 is just temporary and resets with every use.
