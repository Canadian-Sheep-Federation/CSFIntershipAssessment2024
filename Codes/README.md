## Bonus Points

### Discuss how the application and API could be extended and improved

To extend and improve this application, we can use reddis to cache images
Or we can limit the payload
Or we can use a connection pool to avoid unnecessary processing time
Or we can use reverse proxies to increase security, performance, and reliability.

### Discuss how the application and API should be deployed

First, we must use .env files to avoid any secure information in our code.
Then, we need to improve our API to avoid bugs. We can use Unit tests, Integration tests, and more.
We can use docker to deploy our application.
We can use sites like Heroku to deploy our application because this application is simple.
We can also use cloud AWS or GCP to deploy our app.
Before deploying our app, we can use the CI/CD pipeline.
