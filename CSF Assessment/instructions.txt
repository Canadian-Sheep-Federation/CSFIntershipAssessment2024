Hi,

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission.

To run my api: in the terminal run npm install express sqlite3 body-parser axios
then cd into the CSF Assessment directory.
You should the be able to run node src/index.js, there you should be able to access the form from http://localhost:3000 in a web browser
