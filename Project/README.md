# Cat Show Status Code
For each HTTP Status Code, there is a cat picture where users can add comments about it and store their thoughts. Explore and engage with different status codes, leaving your mark on each unique cat image!

## Technologies Used
- Sqlite3
- Node.js + Express for the Backend
- HTML + CSS - Frontend
- [HTTP Cat: Cat for every HTTP Status](https://http.cat/)

## Install Instructions
  - Navigate to the `Project` directory and run `npm install` to install backend dependencies. Note: Sqlite will store data locally under the `db` folder

## Start the project
  - Run `npm run start` to start the server.
  - Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the web application.

## Discuss how the application and api could be extended and improved
- The API could be extended by adding user authentication to secure comment submissions and enabling pagination for fetching comments to handle large datasets efficiently. Additionally, incorporating an image upload feature for user avatars could enhance the user experience.

## Discuss how the application and api should be deployed

- The backend API should be deployed using a reliable cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or Azure. Utilize Docker for containerization, ensuring consistent environments, and set up a CI/CD pipeline for seamless updates and maintenance.

## Intuitive design and user interface

- The frontend should feature an intuitive design with a clean layout, easy navigation, and clear instructions. User-friendly forms and visually appealing elements ensure a smooth and engaging experience for visitors.
