# CSF Software Developer Assessment (Summer 2024)

Usage: Clone the repo. Navigate to directory, and npm install. Enter "npm start" to run
server in production mode, or "npm run dev" to run in development mode. View
web app at localhost:3001 in browser.

## 1. Application and API Extensions/Improvements

-   Add Vimeo embeds so videos can be played within the page (not new tab)
-   Style front end using Tailwind
-   Deploy (render is a free option I've used in the past)
-   Add user authentication and authorization using JWT, allow update/delete operations
    for own video posts
-   Add queries for Vimeo channel/user/showcases (already implemented in Vimeo API wrapper)
-   Allow users to create playlists of vimeo videos
-   Add test environment and test coverage (unit, integration, E2E)
-   Proper error handling on front end

## 2. App & API deployment

-   I've used render to deploy small web apps for free (fly.io is also an option), just requires syncing the public repo
