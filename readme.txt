Created a Restful API which meshes well with Google API.
Database used: sqlite
API uses three methods: post, get{id} and get

To run api first run db.py file and check if the table is created successfully (python db.py)
Then run python app.py

Created google api key from google console--> create credential tab.

This api can be improved by adding more fields, check for duplicates, as of now I am using only three fields i.e name, description and category.
Additional functionalities can be added like filtering, user location routing , user login can be added for privacy and data can be stored in the db for each user.
