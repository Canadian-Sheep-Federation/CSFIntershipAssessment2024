Public API used: Coffee Api, provides random coffee image, json format with link to coffee image. 
API that I build: represents coffee feedback form, rating the image (creativity of image, how good the coffee looks, 1-10 scale), the type of coffee in the image to classify it (ex. latte, pour-over,etc), string. "Would you drink" this yes or no box. 
Web application, button to get image from public api, from response, open image and save id of the image to include in survey response. Enter survey questions. 
button to see if this image has previous responses, or just view all reviews of various images.
