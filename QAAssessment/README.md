1- To investigate and resolve display issues in the browser, I begin by checking the console logs in the Developer Tools. This helps identify JavaScript errors or warnings, providing a starting point for debugging. If the application includes unit tests or test cases, I run them to pinpoint where the issue might be occurring. Consulting documentation for frameworks and libraries is crucial to understand the file structure and find relevant information on best practices. I use JavaScript debuggers in the Developer Tools to step through the code and inspect variable values. Additionally, for backend issues, I utilize Postman to test APIs and ensure they are functioning correctly. This systematic approach helps me effectively identify and resolve display issues in web applications.

2- Most of my broken codes happens in my personal projects/class assigmnets. I fixed it removing code pieces, checking logs, writing test cases, Postman API cases.

3- One of my class assignment, I was expected to do a code review and then do the changings.I had to find a public repository with atleast 10,000+ line of code and 50+ forks. I used a tool which gave me a report of all the code smells and then i fixed them while making sure that the test case still pass.
