# Dog Stories

This Webpage will display a random dog image and ask the user to submit a story about the dog.
The Public API I chose displays random dog images. 
The User will be asked to submit a name for themselves, a name for the dog, and a story about the dog.
These, along with the image URL are sent to the POST endpoint of my API which stores them in a MySQL Database.
The user can then click on the "See Stories" link to view all the stories submitted by other users.
The stories are displayed in a table format with the image, username, dog name, and story.
The user can also search for a specific response by ID.
While the version I have submitted here is not live, you can use a live version on my website at:

There may be slight differences as I would like to make the website prettier and more user-friendly.
This version lacks any CSS or javascript as I did not have time to implement it yet, (Sunday evening).
