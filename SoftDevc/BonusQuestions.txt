Discuss how the application and api could be extended and improved

To make the application and API better, we can start by enhancing error handling to provide clearer messages to users and log errors for developers. 
Adding data validation on both the client and server sides will help ensure that the data is correct and consistent. Switching from an in-memory 
database to a persistent one like PostgreSQL or MongoDB will allow us to save data even if the server is restarted. Introducing user authentication 
and authorization will secure the API endpoints and ensure that only authorized users can access certain features. Implementing rate limiting and 
caching will protect the API from abuse and improve performance by reducing redundant calls. On the frontend, we can improve the user interface 
and user experience by using modern frameworks like React or Vue, and adding features like loading indicators and form validation messages. 
Finally, creating comprehensive API documentation will help other developers understand and use the API effectively.


Discuss how the application and api should be deployed


To deploy the application and API, start by using Docker to containerize the application for consistent deployment. Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) 
pipeline with tools like GitHub Actions to automate building, testing, and deploying. Deploying the application to cloud platforms like AWS or Google 
Cloud Platform using services like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which handle scaling and load balancing.  Use a managed MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas
for reliable and scalable data storage. Adding a reverse proxy like Nginx for traffic management and security would be nice as well. Implement monitoring
and logging with tools like AWS CloudWatch to track performance and quickly fix issues. These approaches ensures the application is reliable, scalable, and secure.

Here is a project I made two years ago which utilized MongoDB and NodeJS to create the backend of an e-commerce website:
