# AI Developer Assesment

I answered my questions in the classification.ipynb notebook. In that notebook first part is where I gave my answer of processing pipeline, where I just gave a broad idea of how I would use that model. In the second part of that notebook I have written code to classify 2 datasets:  MNIST and CIFAR_10. In that I am splitting the dataset into train,validation and test set. By using logistic regression I tested the accuracy on these datasets.
