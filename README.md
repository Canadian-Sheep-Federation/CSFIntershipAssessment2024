# CSF Intership Assessment 2024

## Software Developer Assessment:
I created a simple web RESTful application which displays trivia questions based on a topic and difficulty of your choosing

To run the program, ensure you are using python 3.9 or greater then do the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x app.py
./app.py
```

## AI Developer Assessment
I created convolutional neural network (CNN) and SVM and trained MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. I also generated accuracy and validation loss graph to compare performance between the two models.

To run, ensure you are using python 3.9 or greater, then do the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
chmod +x graph.py
./graph.py
```

The program will generate three images which contain the performance graphs. I have already provided the images for you, but feel free to run the program (but it might take some time to run).
