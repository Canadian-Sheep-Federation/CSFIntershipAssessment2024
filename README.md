**Overview**
The chosen public API was WeatherStack (https://weatherstack.com/) where the user is able to check the weather for their city. The REST-ful API allows the user to create ToDo items that can be adjusted based off the weather. The user can also update and get specific items or get the entire list of ToDo items.

**Instructions to run**

1. Install dependencies with npm install

2. Run node app.js to run the server locally

3. The server can be found at http://localhost:3000/


**Bonus Question**
**Discuss how the application and api could be extended and improved**
Some of the features I would include are:
- The ability to check weather for future dates. This would allow for more flexiblity in planning events or tasks and would make more sense for planning certain activities for the future. 
- The ability to register as a user. This would allow different users to view their own ToDo lists and potentially lead into the ability to create events and invite other users to events.
- The ability to sort ToDo items based on certain criteria, such as name, location, or date.
- Updated UI. Currently the priority for the UI is ease-of-use, but in the future it would be ideal to make it more visually appealing.

**Discuss how the application and api should be deployed**
- The backend could be deployed using Microsoft SQL Server. 
- The frontend can be hosted on an any website hosting service, such as Heroku.
